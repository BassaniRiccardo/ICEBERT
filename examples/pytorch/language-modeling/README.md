## ICEBERT Language model training

The ICEBERT model builds on the BERT model, but includes 9 different languages:
{Arabic, Bengali, English, Finnish, Indonesian, Korean, Russian, Swahili, Telugu}.

### Requirements

The torch xla distribution is required for TPUs training. Need free TPUs? Check https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc .


### Data preparation

1. Download wikipedia Dumps.
2. Extract .xml dumps to .txt files using the WikiExtractor script.
3. For each language, concatenate short sentences in the corpus so that all lines contain a number of tokens close to MAX_SEQ.
This must be done manually here, since TPUs require the --line_by_line flag. While doing this, also lowercase the baseline corpus and create the cID corpus for each language.
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  preprocess 
If we want to include a first training with max_seq=128, we must also run:
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  preprocess --max_seq 128
4. Compute the number of lines per corpus:
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  count_lines
5. Get the oversampled number of lines (default ALPHA=0.3, cite paper) per language:
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  derive_lines
6. Create a single large corpus. English lines are mantained, while other languages' ones are duplicated. Shuffle the obtained corpus. Do this for both the baseline and the model:
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  oversample
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  oversample --cid
If we want to include a first training with max_seq=128, we must also run:
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  oversample --max_seq 128
    python create_oversampled_wikicorpus.py  oversample --cid --max_seq 128
As oversampling factors, we can use the same independently from the max_seq.


### Training
1. Modify the script run_mlm.py so that it takes the correct txt files as input and loads the dataset using the path="text" as builder script.
2. Call the training script from xla_spawn.py:
    python xla_spawn.py --num_cores=NUM_CORES_YOU_HAVE 
                        run_mlm_icebert.py (--icebert_train_config.json)




## HuggingFace general language model training

Fine-tuning (or training from scratch) the library models for language modeling on a text dataset for GPT, GPT-2,
ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, XLNet... GPT and GPT-2 are trained or fine-tuned using a causal language modeling
(CLM) loss while ALBERT, BERT, DistilBERT and RoBERTa are trained or fine-tuned using a masked language modeling (MLM)
loss. XLNet uses permutation language modeling (PLM), you can find more information about the differences between those
objectives in our [model summary](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_summary.html).

There are two sets of scripts provided. The first set leverages the Trainer API. The second set with `no_trainer` in the suffix uses a custom training loop and leverages the ðŸ¤— Accelerate library . Both sets use the ðŸ¤— Datasets library. You can easily customize them to your needs if you need extra processing on your datasets.

**Note:** The old script `run_language_modeling.py` is still available [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/legacy/run_language_modeling.py).

The following examples, will run on datasets hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or with your own
text files for training and validation. We give examples of both below.

### GPT-2/GPT and causal language modeling

The following example fine-tunes GPT-2 on WikiText-2. We're using the raw WikiText-2 (no tokens were replaced before
the tokenization). The loss here is that of causal language modeling.

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This takes about half an hour to train on a single K80 GPU and about one minute for the evaluation to run. It reaches
a score of ~20 perplexity once fine-tuned on the dataset.

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_clm.py \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

This uses the built in HuggingFace `Trainer` for training. If you want to use a custom training loop, you can utilize or adapt the `run_clm_no_trainer.py` script. Take a look at the script for a list of supported arguments. An example is shown below:

```bash
python run_clm_no_trainer.py \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --model_name_or_path gpt2 \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-clm
```

### RoBERTa/BERT/DistilBERT and masked language modeling

The following example fine-tunes RoBERTa on WikiText-2. Here too, we're using the raw WikiText-2. The loss is different
as BERT/RoBERTa have a bidirectional mechanism; we're therefore using the same loss that was used during their
pre-training: masked language modeling.

In accordance to the RoBERTa paper, we use dynamic masking rather than static masking. The model may, therefore,
converge slightly slower (over-fitting takes more epochs).

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm
```

To run on your own training and validation files, use the following command:

```bash
python run_mlm.py \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm
```

If your dataset is organized with one sample per line, you can use the `--line_by_line` flag (otherwise the script
concatenates all texts and then splits them in blocks of the same length).

This uses the built in HuggingFace `Trainer` for training. If you want to use a custom training loop, you can utilize or adapt the `run_mlm_no_trainer.py` script. Take a look at the script for a list of supported arguments. An example is shown below:

```bash
python run_mlm_no_trainer.py \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --model_name_or_path roberta-base \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-mlm
```

**Note:** On TPU, you should use the flag `--pad_to_max_length` in conjunction with the `--line_by_line` flag to make
sure all your batches have the same length.

### Whole word masking

This part was moved to `examples/research_projects/mlm_wwm`.

### XLNet and permutation language modeling

XLNet uses a different training objective, which is permutation language modeling. It is an autoregressive method
to learn bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the input
sequence factorization order.

We use the `--plm_probability` flag to define the ratio of length of a span of masked tokens to surrounding
context length for permutation language modeling.

The `--max_span_length` flag may also be used to limit the length of a span of masked tokens used
for permutation language modeling.

Here is how to fine-tune XLNet on wikitext-2:

```bash
python run_plm.py \
    --model_name_or_path=xlnet-base-cased \
    --dataset_name wikitext \
    --dataset_config_name wikitext-2-raw-v1 \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-plm
```

To fine-tune it on your own training and validation file, run:

```bash
python run_plm.py \
    --model_name_or_path=xlnet-base-cased \
    --train_file path_to_train_file \
    --validation_file path_to_validation_file \
    --do_train \
    --do_eval \
    --output_dir /tmp/test-plm
```

If your dataset is organized with one sample per line, you can use the `--line_by_line` flag (otherwise the script
concatenates all texts and then splits them in blocks of the same length).

**Note:** On TPU, you should use the flag `--pad_to_max_length` in conjunction with the `--line_by_line` flag to make
sure all your batches have the same length.
