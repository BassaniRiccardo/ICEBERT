This folder contains ICEBERT-specific files:
- Monolingual tokenizers
- Baseline and Model tokenizers
- Wikiextractor script
- cid mapping script
- cID mapper
- configuration json files 

Note: cID mapper and tokenizers are provided here for 9 languages.
The process that led to their creation can be reproduces following the Jupyter notebooks in the "clustering_notebooks" folder.
The notebooks can also be modified to include more languages.
